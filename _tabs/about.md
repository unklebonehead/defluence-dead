### The origin story
The Defluenced Podcast (hosted by [Unkle Bonehead](https://unklebonehead.xyz) & [Allen Taylor](https://authorallentaylor.com/)) is what inspired this site and the mission it is currently on. While it has taken several forms already over the last year. I think we have finally settled on a look and feel. The url is the way it is because I am planning on doing a lot of articles and pages to help on board as many people to real world Web3 that works.

Right now in 2023 there is only one that works as advertised and it has a plethora of apps already built and operating right now. These apps span the gamut from social media, multi media and games.

In Web3 **you** have complete control over what you post. **You** retain ownership of **all** of what you post. There is no board of directors, no CEO and no way to delete you or your content. You don't have to post your content to 10 different sites to be seen. You have a log in. You have an identity and it gets you everywhere. All of this is powered by [Hive](https://hive.io).

Thousands of us are there already and you are more than welcome to come join us.
You can join Hive by using my referal [link](https://hiveonboard.com?ref=unklebonehead).

Feel free to contact me either by email or the old social media and I will help in any way I can.
